We solved the problem of inventory management at James R. Oliverâ€™s building at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The current approach employed by the system administrator has not been as effective and efficient as it should be. It has been a challenge for the inventory manager and his team to maintain and track the status of every piece of equipment within the James R. Oliver at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. We all know that businesses that are sloppy with equipment management suffer considerably since it is impossible to keep track of thefts, stock levels, or storage expenses. That is why we have decided to come up with a technical solution to this problem. The intended user population for this design is the system administrator (user type 1), administrative assistant (user type 2), and Faculty staff of ULL with the focus being on the system administrator. All groups will have access to this software, but the system administrator will be the sole administrator of this software.
